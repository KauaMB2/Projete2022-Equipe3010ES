>CEPEG was a project developed trying to help any type of company that uses PPE in its work environment. The project is divided into three stages:

>1st Stage - Cognitive test;<br>
>2nd Stage - Recognition of the employee;<br>
>3rd Stage - Recognition of PPE.<br>

In the 1st stage, the employee undergoes a cognitive test, developed in Python (Pygame), which will test the employee's cognition, to determine whether or not he is able to perform risky work.
In the 2nd stage, when the employee clocks in, he chooses one of the 3 forms of recognition: Facial recognition, biometrics or RFID reader. The recognition of the employee must be done to verify whether or not the employee works in that sector and to register his/her entry.
In the 3rd and last step, the employee must position himself in front of a camera that will be connected to the computer and which, through Artificial Intelligence (Machine Learning), will determine whether or not the employee is using PPE. The verification time takes around 8 seconds.
If the employee is using the PPE correctly, a turnstile releases the employee's access to the work sector, but if the employee is not using it, a message is automatically sent to his boss's WhatsApp, warning about the misuse of the PPE. PPE.

The project also has a website and a GUI (Graphic Interface) to register employees and sectors of the company. In addition, the GUI and the Site also display graphs, tables, reports and images that confirm whether or not the employee was using PPE. All website information is stored in Firebase and GUI information in MySQL.

CEPEG was the best project in the Utilities category and won the City Hall award.

Technologies used in the creation of the project: Electronics, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, Python, NodeJS, C++, OpenCV, Machine Learning, Firebase and MySQL.
